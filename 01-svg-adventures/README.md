## What is this SVG?

<details>
  <summary>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</summary>

A web-friendly vector file format. As opposed to pixel-based raster files like JPEGs, vector files store images via mathematical formulas based on points and lines on a grid.
SVG is a markup language and is based on XML and is resolution-independent. SVG supports various shapes, can be styled with CSS, and allows for interactivity and animation. It can be embedded into HTML using the `<svg></svg>` element.

Initial release in 2001.
